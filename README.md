# KNN-classifier-in-java
Implement the PointData, Node, PointList and KNN classes specified in the data KNN.java file. In the implementation of the methods you should not use arrays (tables), except for x-point representation, where needed.Make good use of the methods of the PointList list that you will implement. And only add private fields or methods.

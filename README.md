# KNN-classifier-in-java
You will implement the PointData, Node, PointList and KNN classes specified in the data KNN.java file. In the implementation of the methods you should not use arrays (tables), except for x-point representation, where needed. You will make good use of the methods of the PointList list that you will implement. You can only add private fields or methods.
